        - **Scale**: 1.2M grant payments worth $330B power Alberta's post-2014
            diversification strategy.
        - **Focus**: Human Services, Health, and Education absorb most dollars,

        - **Trajectory**: Funding nearly doubled from 2014 to 2024.
                        Recipients grew by roughly 25%.

    **Deeper look:** Alberta's decade-long grant strategy traces back to

    #### Education & Research
    - Largest growth trajectory across sectors
    - Workforce retraining and skills development
    - Innovation and knowledge infrastructure investments

    #### Healthcare & Social Services
    - Human Services alone channels $4.4B to non-profitsâ€”double any other

    - Safety nets expand during volatile years
    - Preventative, community-based care takes centre stage

    #### Public Administration
    - Service delivery and governance infrastructure upgrades
    - Digital transformation and efficiency mandates
    - Regulatory and compliance frameworks supported

    #### Agriculture & Rural Development
    - Diversification reaches beyond urban centres
    - Food security and sustainable farming initiatives grow
    - Rural resilience programs reinforce local economies

    **Trendline:** Funding climbs from 830M in 2014-15 to 1.5B in
    2023-24. That is a compound annual growth rate near 5.6%. Recipient
    counts grow by roughly 25%, signalling broader participation without

    Homeless Foundation (252M), Providence Child Development Society

    """
    Alberta's fiscal policy now synthetically props up social ministries by
    recycling ever-larger grant pools. The visuals show that despite a decade
    of rising allocations, employment in these grant-dependent fields merely
    treads water while self-sustaining industries stagnate or shrink. That
    dynamic traps the province in a feedback loopâ€”Public Administration,
    Education, Health, and Human Services keep the jobs supplied by grants,
    yet the underlying problems linger and deepen.

    Increasing award amounts keep the current workforce afloat, but they no
    longer expand opportunity. If other sectors continue to erode, the tax
    base that funds these grants will thin, forcing difficult trade-offs even
    as signature campaigns such as the green dividend succeed (a story beyond
    this dashboard). The charts imply that future decisions must confront this
    structural imbalance: redirect capital toward genuinely productive fields,
    demand measurable sustainability from social programs, or accept a tighter
    fiscal horizon where grant-driven employment is the ceiling rather than a
    bridge to broader growth.
